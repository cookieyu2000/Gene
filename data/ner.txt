31964843 | t | Worldwide carrier frequency and genetic prevalence of autosomal recessive inherited retinal diseases.
31964843 | a | One of the major questions in human genetics is what percentage of individuals in the general population carry a disease-causing mutation. Based on publicly available information on genotypes from six main world populations, we created a database including data on 276,921 sequence variants, present within 187 genes associated with autosomal recessive (AR) inherited retinal diseases (IRDs). Assessment of these variants revealed that 10,044 were categorized as disease-causing mutations. We developed an algorithm to compute the gene-specific prevalence of disease, as well as the mutational burden in healthy subjects. We found that the genetic prevalence of AR-IRDs corresponds approximately to 1 case in 1,380 individuals, with 5.5 million people expected to be affected worldwide. In addition, we calculated that unaffected carriers of mutations are numerous, ranging from 1 in 2.26 individuals in Europeans to 1 in 3.50 individuals in the Finnish population. Our analysis indicates that about 2.7 billion people worldwide (36% of the population) are healthy carriers of at least one mutation that can cause AR-IRD, a value that is probably the highest across any group of Mendelian conditions in humans.

27734943 | t | Identification of the Photoreceptor Transcriptional Co-Repressor SAMD11 as Novel Cause of Autosomal Recessive Retinitis Pigmentosa.
27734943 | a | Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the most frequent form of inherited retinal dystrophy is characterized by progressive photoreceptor degeneration. Many genes have been implicated in RP development, but several others remain to be identified. Using a combination of homozygosity mapping, whole-exome and targeted next-generation sequencing, we found a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in SAMD11 in five individuals diagnosed with adult-onset RP from two unrelated consanguineous Spanish families. SAMD11 is ortholog to the mouse major retinal SAM domain (mr-s) protein that is implicated in CRX-mediated transcriptional regulation in the retina. Accordingly, protein-protein network analysis revealed a significant interaction of SAMD11 with CRX. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed strong expression of SAMD11 in human retina. Immunolocalization studies revealed SAMD11 was detected in the three nuclear layers of the human retina and interestingly differential expression between cone and rod photoreceptors was observed. Our study strongly implicates SAMD11 as novel cause of RP playing an important role in the pathogenesis of human degeneration of photoreceptors.

29738522 | t | De novo and inherited private variants in MAP1B in periventricular nodular heterotopia.
29738522 | a | Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) is a malformation of cortical development commonly associated with epilepsy. We exome sequenced 202 individuals with sporadic PVNH to identify novel genetic risk loci. We first performed a trio-based analysis and identified 219 de novo variants. Although no novel genes were implicated in this initial analysis, PVNH cases were found overall to have a significant excess of nonsynonymous de novo variants in intolerant genes (p = 3.27x10-7), suggesting a role for rare new alleles in genes yet to be associated with the condition. Using a gene-level collapsing analysis comparing cases and controls, we identified a genome-wide significant signal driven by four ultra-rare loss-of-function heterozygous variants in MAP1B, including one de novo variant. In at least one instance, the MAP1B variant was inherited from a parent with previously undiagnosed PVNH. The PVNH was frontally predominant and associated with perisylvian polymicrogyria. These results implicate MAP1B in PVNH. More broadly, our findings suggest that detrimental mutations likely arising in immediately preceding generations with incomplete penetrance may also be responsible for some apparently sporadic diseases.

32368696 | t | Systems Analysis Implicates WAVE2 Complex in the Pathogenesis of Developmental Left-Sided Obstructive Heart Defects.
32368696 | a | Genetic variants are the primary driver of congenital heart disease (CHD) pathogenesis. However, our ability to identify causative variants is limited. To identify causal CHD genes that are associated with specific molecular functions, the study used prior knowledge to filter de novo variants from 2,881 probands with sporadic severe CHD. This approach enabled the authors to identify an association between left ventricular outflow tract obstruction lesions and genes associated with the WAVE2 complex and regulation of small GTPase-mediated signal transduction. Using CRISPR zebrafish knockdowns, the study confirmed that WAVE2 complex proteins brk1, nckap1, and wasf2 and the regulators of small GTPase signaling cul3a and racgap1 are critical to cardiac development.
